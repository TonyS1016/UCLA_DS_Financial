2. 
Suppose X is a normally distributed RV w/ mean 0 and var 1
Compute the following using the R functions pnorm and qnorm 

```{r cars}
#a. Pr(X< -1.96)
p1a = pnorm(-1.96, mean=0, sd=1)
p1a

#b. Pr(X > 1.64)
p1b = pnorm(1.64, mean=0, sd=1)
p1b_answer = 1 - p1b
p1b_answer

#c. Pr(-0.5 < X < 0.5)
p1c = pnorm(-0.5, mean=0, sd=1)
p1c_2 = pnorm(0.5,mean=0,sd=1)
p1c_2
p1c_answer = p1c_2 - p1c
p1c_answer

#d. 1% Quantile (q.01) and 99% Quantile (q.99)
qnorm(.01, mean=0, sd=1)
qnorm(.99,mean=0,sd=1)

#e. 5% Quantile (q.05) and 95% Quantile (q.99)
qnorm(.05,mean=0,sd=1)
qnorm(.99,mean=0,sd=1)

```

Let X denote monthly return on Microsoft Stock and Y is the monthly return for SBUX
Assume X follows N(.05,.1) amd Y follow N(.025,.05)

```{r}
#a. Using a grid of values b/n -.25 and .35, plot the normal curves for X and Y on the same plot 
x = seq(-.25,.35,.01)
f.x <- dnorm(x,mean=.05,sd=.1)
f.y = dnorm(x,mean=.025,sd=.05)

plot(f.y~x, type="l", col="red", ylab="f(x)", main="Density Curves for Microsoft and Starbucks")
lines(f.x~x, type="l", col="blue")

#b. 

#It looks like SBUX is a lot more consistent and has less variance. 
#Microsoft however has a higher average return, but more variance. 
#I would just choose Microsoft as it has higher return and I am also biased as I have Microsoft stocks myself. 

```

Part 2 R Questions 

1.

```{r}
#Suppose that X is a normal random variable with mean 0:1
#and variance 1. Using Monte Carlo simulation to Ã–nd the probability that X>=0.5
set.seed(123) 
runs <- 5000
mu.x <- 0.1
sigma.x <- 1

X <- rnorm(runs, mu.x, sigma.x) 
sum(X>=0.5)/runs
```



2. 
```{r}
#Flip a coin, you and a friend guess the outcome H or T
#If you both guess the same, lose 3 if H, lose 1 if T
#If guess is different from your friend, you win 2
#You both observe the prob of observing H is 0.5
#What is the expectation of the money you will win from this game?

set.seed(321)
X2 <- matrix(rbinom(runs*2,size = 1, prob = 0.5), ncol = 2)
head(X2)

Y <- ifelse(X2[,1]==1 & X2[,2]==1, -3,
            ifelse(X2[,1]==0 & X2[,2]==0 , -1, 2))
head(cbind(X,Y)) 

sum(Y)/runs
```



3. 
```{r}
#Consider the game described in #2, Now you play the game w/ Prob(X=1)=0.36
#Suppose your friend still has Prob(X=1)=0.5
#What is the expectation of the money you will win from this game?

            ifelse(X3_Person1[,1]==0 & X3_Person2[,2]==0 , -1, 2))
head(cbind(X,Y)) 

sum(Y)/runs
```



4. 
```{r}
#Consider the game in #2. Mathematically, we can show that strategy in #3 
#Guarantees that you will win money from your friend regardless the guess of your friend 
#If you play the games many times with your friend. That is, we can show that 
#the expectation of the money you get from the  game is positive regardless of
#your friends guess. Check this by simulation


sum(Y)/runs
  #It has a positive expected value 

```
